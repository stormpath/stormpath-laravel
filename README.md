## Getting Started

Follow these steps to add Stormpath user authentication to your Laravel app.

1. **Download Your Key File**

  [Download your key file](https://support.stormpath.com/hc/en-us/articles/221077627-Where-do-I-find-my-API-key-) from the Stormpath Console.

2. **Store Your Key As Environment Variables**

  Open your key file and grab the **API Key ID** and **API Key Secret**, then add this to your `.env` file in the root of your project:

  ```php
  STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=<YOUR-ID-HERE>
  STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET=<YOUR-SECRET-HERE>
  ```

3. **Get Your Stormpath App HREF**

  Login to the [Stormpath Console](https://api.stormpath.com/) and grab the *HREF* (called **REST URL** in the UI) of your *Application*. It should look something like this:

  `https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/q42unYAj6PDLxth9xKXdL`

4. **Store Your Stormpath App HREF In the `.env` file**

  ```php
  STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF=<YOUR-STORMPATH-APP-HREF>
  ```

5. **Install The Package**
    
  Open your composer.json file and add the following to your require block:
  
  ```bash
  "stormpath/laravel": "^0.4"
  ```

6. **Include It In Your App**

   Open you `config/app.php` file and add the following to your providers section

  ```php
  Stormpath\Laravel\Support\StormpathLaravelServiceProvider::class
  ```

7. **Configure It**

  To modify the configuration of the package, you will need to publish the config file. Run the following in your terminal:

  ```bash
  $ php artisan vendor:publish
  ```

8. **Protect Your Routes**

  You can use `stormpath.auth` as a middleware to protect your routes:

  ```php
  Route::get('/page', ['middleware'=>'stormpath.auth']);
  ```

  If the user tries to access this route without being logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

  If you want to make sure ONLY guests can use the route, You can use `stormpath.guest` as a middleware:
  ```php
    Route::get('/page', ['middleware'=>'stormpath.guest']);
  ```

  If the user tries to access this route while logged in, they will be redirected to the home page.

9. **Login**

  To access a protected route, the user must first login.

  You can login by visiting the `/login` URL and submitting the login form.


10. **Register**

  To be able to login, your users first need an account.

  Users can register by visiting the `/register` URL and submitting the
  registration form.

11. **That's It!**

  You just added user authentication to your app with Stormpath. See the [documentation][] for further information on how Stormpath can be used with your Laravel app.
